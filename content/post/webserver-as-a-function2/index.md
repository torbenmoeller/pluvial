# TL;DR
Python functions on GCP need an entrypoint for every HTTP request.
You can define one entrypoint that routes traffic to normal Flask methods.
This makes hosting web services with Cloud Function a breeze.

# Motivation 
* Very fast setup of a local web server 
* Same behaviour on GCP
* One deployment artefact can contain static and dynamic parts

# Prerequisites
1. Installed python
2. Flask library is available

# Approach
## The Flask App
The Flask app has a simple api endpoint that return "Hello from the api!".
It also hosts a static file called index.html that is placed in the static folder. 
Running locally the web server is reachable at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html).
For more information see the [previous post](https://pluvial.dev/post/webserver-as-a-function/).

{{< highlight python >}}
from flask import Flask, Request

# This serves static content
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static', static_url_path='/')

# Backend code can be written normally
@app.route('/api')
def api():
    return "Hello from the api!"

## Preparing for Google Cloud Function
Google Cloud Functions need a method as an entry point for execution. 
This means if a Cloud Function is triggered, it prepares the runtime environment and triggers the entry point.

The name of the method can be chosen freely. 
In the code example the method is named gcp_entry_point. As parameter the method receives a Request object. 
The Request class is imported from flask. The object implements access to headers, mime-type and of course data that
might have been sent.

This code takes the Request from the entry point and routes it through the processing methods of Flask.


{{< highlight python >}}
from flask import Request
def gcp_entry_point(request: Request):
    with app.request_context(request.environ):
        try:
            rv = app.preprocess_request()
            if rv is None:
                rv = app.dispatch_request()
        except Exception as e:
            rv = app.handle_user_exception(e)
        response = app.make_response(rv)
        return app.process_response(response)

The code comes from this
[Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66026762/1499913)
 that was provided by [Martin](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4443309/martin).

## Deploy on GCP
The code is now ready to run as Cloud Function. You can use this gcloud command start the deployment. 
Important is the parameter --entry-point gcp_entry_point. This marks the method from before as entry point.
After the deployment the function is reachable by the trigger URL. 
It looks like "https://[REGION]-[PROJECT-NAME].cloudfunctions.net/waaf".

{{< highlight powershell >}}
# Deploy the function
gcloud functions deploy waaf --runtime python39 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --entry-point gcp_entry_point
# Clean up (Needs additional approval)
gcloud functions delete waaf

{{< hint >}}
âš  The cloud function is reachable from the internet by default!
This can lead to security issues and high costs!

# Further Reading
* Code can be found in [this GitHub project](https://github.com/torbenmoeller/pluvial-waaf).
* The gcp_entry_point is only used by the Google Cloud Function. Locally, the requests are directly routed to the Flask methods.
